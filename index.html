Let's play a game! <br><br> Imagine yourself as an investor or a businessman that has invested in a company that sells the product or service of your choice (Note: You can even choose a product category such as durable goods, non-durable goods or services! In such cases, you are managing a diversified conglomerate. Isn't it exciting?). Follow the ups and downs (or, more precisely, right and left) of the orange bubble, what would you do to solve various crises that you will be going through since 1960? <br><br> Obviously, the best business is one that is large in size, grows extremely fast and never suffers any significant losses. So, one of the ways to solve a crisis is to avoid one! As Charlie Munger once said, <i>"All I Want To Know Is Where I'm Going To Die So I'll Never Go There."</i><br><br> Can you pick a product that has never suffered a drop in revenue and is growing at a fast rate? <br><br> </h3></div>
